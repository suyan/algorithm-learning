## 1. Question
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
### Note 
- You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
- You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
- Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
- There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## 2. Analysis

- every number should be in number - 1 index
- so swap word to its position, if current position has the same number, that's the duplicate one

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int len = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == i + 1) {
                continue;
            }
            int oldIndex = i;
            int newIndex = nums[i] - 1;
            while (nums[oldIndex] != oldIndex + 1) {
                if (nums[oldIndex] == nums[newIndex]) {
                    return nums[oldIndex];
                }
                swap(nums[oldIndex], nums[newIndex]);
                newIndex = nums[oldIndex] - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
