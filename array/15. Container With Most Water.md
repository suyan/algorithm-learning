## 1. Question
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

### Example
Given [1,3,2], the max area of the container is 2.

### Note 
You may not slant the container.

## 2. Analysis

- use two pointers to find heightest bar
    - if left > right right--
    - else left++

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param heights: a vector of integers
     * @return: an integer
     */
    int maxArea(vector<int> &heights) {
        int max = 0, area;
        int start = 0, end = heights.size() - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            if (heights[start] > heights[end]) {
                area = heights[end] * (end - start);
                end--;
            } else {
                area = heights[start] * (end - start);
                start++;
            }

            if (area > max) {
                max = area;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```
