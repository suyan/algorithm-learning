## 1. Question
Given an array of integers, how many three numbers can be found in the array, so that we can build an triangle whose three edges length is the three numbers that we find?

### Example
```
Given array S = [3,4,6,7], return 3. They are:

[3,4,6]
[3,6,7]
[4,6,7]
Given array S = [4,4,4,4], return 4. They are:

[4(1),4(2),4(3)]
[4(1),4(2),4(4)]
[4(1),4(3),4(4)]
[4(2),4(3),4(4)]
```
## 2. Analysis

- The brute force approach need three loops, so the time complexity is $O(n^3)$
- To optimize it, we can use two pointers to find triangles in $O(n^2)$
  - sort array
  - use a loop to bind one number first, and in remaining array use two pointers
    - if left + right > ith, that means all numbers between left right can be used, then right--
    - if left + right <= ith, that means we need larger left to fulfil triangle restriction

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int triangleCount(vector<int> &S) {
        int left = 0, right = S.size() - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        sort(S.begin(), S.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            left = 0;
            right = i - 1;
            while (left < right) {
                if (S[left] + S[right] > S[i]) {
                    ans = ans + (right - left);
                    right--;
                } else {
                    left++;
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
