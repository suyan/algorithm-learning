## 1. Question
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

### Example
A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty], B = [4, 5]
After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
### Note 
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.

## 2. Analysis

- use two pointers to choose next number
- from A's end to start, put next number

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param A: sorted integer array A which has m elements, 
     *           but size of A is m+n
     * @param B: sorted integer array B which has n elements
     * @return: void
     */
    void mergeSortedArray(int A[], int m, int B[], int n) {
        int pos = m + n - 1, i = m - 1, j = n - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            A[pos--] = A[i] > B[j] ? A[i--] : B[j--];
        }
        while (i >= 0) {
            A[pos--] = A[i--];
        }
        while (j >= 0) {
            A[pos--] = B[j--];
        }
    }
};
