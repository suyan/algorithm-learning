## 1. Question
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Example
Given an example [2,1,2,0,1], return 2

## 2. Analysis

- because we can buy and sell any times, so we can buy everyday and sell it next day, so if the price is become higher, we get profit, otherwise we didn't lost any money

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param prices: Given an integer array
     * @return: Maximum profit
     */
    int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size() - 1; i++) {
            int diff = prices[i+1] - prices[i];
            if (diff > 0) {
                result += diff;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
