## 1. Question
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

### Example
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

### Note 
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

## 2. Analysis
- use two pointers, one is word1 and another one is word2
- compare two pointers every time we find one of them

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        if (words.size() <= 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int w1 = -1;
        int w2 = -1;
        int minDis = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            if (words[i] == word1) {
                w1 = i;
            } else if (words[i] == word2) {
                w2 = i;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
            if (w1 != -1 && w2 != -1) {
                 minDis = min(minDis, abs(w1 - w2));
            }
        }
        return minDis;
    }
};
```
