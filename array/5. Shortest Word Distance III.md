## 1. Question
This is a follow up of Shortest Word Distance. The only difference is now word1 could be the same as word2.

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.
### Example
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1.
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3.
### Note 
You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.
## 2. Analysis

- if words are not equal, do same thing like [6. Shortest Word Distance](quiver:///notes/D4E52429-E28E-460E-A001-F7EC041CEEE9)
- else just use w1 to compare with i

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        if (words.size() <= 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int w1 = -1;
        int w2 = -1;
        int minDis = INT_MAX;
        bool isSame = (word1 == word2);
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            int prev;
            if (words[i] == word1) {
                prev = w1;
                w1 = i;
            } else if (words[i] == word2) {
                w2 = i;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
            if (isSame && prev != -1)  {
                minDis = min(minDis, abs(w1 - prev));
            } else if (w1 != -1 && w2 != -1) {
                minDis = min(minDis, abs(w1 - w2));
            }
        }
        return minDis;
    }
};
