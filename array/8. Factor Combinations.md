## 1. Question
Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,

8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.

### Example

```
input: 1
output: 
[]

input: 37
output: 
[]
input: 12
output:
[
  [2, 6],
  [2, 2, 3],
  [3, 4]
]

input: 32
output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
  [2, 4, 4],
  [4, 8]
]
```

### Note 

- Each combination's factors must be sorted ascending, for example: The factors of 2 and 6 is [2, 6], not [6, 2].
- You may assume that n is always positive.
- Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.

## 2. Analysis

- use dfs to iterator every factor
- must use a from index to make sure don't generate duplicate factors

## 3. Solution

```CPP
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getFactors(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        if (n <= 3) {
            return results;
        }
        vector<int> factors;
        findFactors(n, 2, factors, results);
        
        return results;
    }
private:
    void findFactors(int n, int from, vector<int> &factors, vector<vector<int>> &results) {
        if (n == 1) {
            if (factors.size() == 1) {
                return;
            } else {
                results.push_back(factors);
                return;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = from; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                factors.push_back(i);
                findFactors(n/i, i, factors, results);
                factors.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
};
```
